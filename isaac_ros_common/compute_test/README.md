# Compute Sanity Tests

These are simple tests designed for basic debugging and sanity checking of Isaac ROS compute packages.

The primary purpose of these tests is to confirm that the core functionalities of the compute packages are operational. This serves as a quick verification that the Isaac ROS Docker container environment is configured and working as expected. The intent is to use these for debugging if package tests are failing.
