# FORK NOTES

The intent is to keep this fork as stock as possible.
To do, that first attempt is to keep the modification points to a minimum.

Currently we use the following files:

- IRDC Docker File Package Manifest: https://github.com/robosoft-ai/isaac_ros_common/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.ros2_humble
- run_dev.sh: https://github.com/robosoft-ai/isaac_ros_common/blob/main/scripts/run_dev.sh

Need to make this thing stop deleting the container every time you turn the computer off.

# Isaac ROS Common

Dockerfiles and scripts for development using the Isaac ROS suite.

## Overview

The Isaac ROS Common
repository contains a number of scripts and Dockerfiles to help
streamline development and testing with the Isaac ROS suite.

<div align="center"><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/.github/main/resources/isaac_ros_docs/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_common/isaac_ros_common_tools.png/"><img alt="Isaac ROS DevOps tools" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/.github/main/resources/isaac_ros_docs/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_common/isaac_ros_common_tools.png/" width="auto"/></a></div>

Docker containers allow you to quickly set up a sensitive set of frameworks
and dependencies to ensure a smooth experience with Isaac ROS packages.
The Dockerfiles for x86_64 are based on the version 23.10 image from [Deep Learning
Frameworks Containers](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html).
On Jetson platforms, JetPack manages all of these dependencies for you.

Use of Docker images enables CI|CD systems to scale with DevOps work and
run automated testing in cloud native platforms on Kubernetes.
