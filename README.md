Docker containers allow you to quickly set up a sensitive set of frameworks
and dependencies to ensure a smooth experience with Isaac ROS packages.
The Dockerfiles for x86_64 are based on the version 23.10 image from [Deep Learning
Frameworks Containers](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html).
On Jetson platforms, JetPack manages all of these dependencies for you.

Use of Docker images enables CI|CD systems to scale with DevOps work and
run automated testing in cloud native platforms on Kubernetes.
